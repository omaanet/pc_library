Ensure compatibility with React Fast Refresh
Always verify imports and exports to avoid unnecessary dependencies
Avoid deeply nested blocks, prefer shallow nesting
Avoid duplication of existing code
Never overwrite `.env` file without explicit confirmation

Only touch code relevant to the task, avoid unrelated areas
Follow the separation of concerns principle and keep the two projects distinct.
When creating or modifying the code, always find and implement the simplest solution: do not overcomplicate the code or the logic.
Be sure to check for existing and potentially reusable classes, utilities, or components before developing new frameworks or writing new code.
If a large change is necessary, STOP, inform the user, and ask for confirmation

When in doubt, when you are not sure about something or you need more details or information, stop and ask user for clarification: if needed propose different options.
