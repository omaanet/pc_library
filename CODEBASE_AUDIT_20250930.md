# Codebase Audit Report - 2025-09-30

## Executive Summary

This audit analyzed the Next.js/React application codebase for potential errors, code smells, security issues, performance problems, and improvement opportunities. The analysis covered the main application structure, API routes, components, utilities, and configuration files.

## Critical Issues (Affects Core Functionality)

### [x] A-001 **Hardcoded Database Connection in Client Components**

**File:** `src/components/books/previews-collection.tsx:28`
**Issue:** Direct database queries in client components (`/api/books?displayPreviews=1&sortOrder=desc&isVisible=1`).
**Impact:** API calls should be centralized, not hardcoded in components. This violates separation of concerns and makes testing difficult.
**Recommendation:** Move API logic to custom hooks or service layers.

## High Priority Issues (Performance & Security)

### [x] A-003 **Hardcoded Sort Order in Database Query**
**File:** `src/lib/db.ts:185`
**Issue:** Sort order is hardcoded as `ORDER BY has_audio ASC, display_order ASC` despite function parameters for configurable sorting.
**Impact:** `sortBy` and `sortOrder` parameters are ignored, limiting sorting flexibility.
**Recommendation:** Implement the commented sorting logic to use the provided parameters.

**Additional specifications:** Don't rely solely on the commented code; create the correct and necessary logic to use the parameters yourself. You can analyze the commented code to understand how it was originally intended, but always ensure the generated code is correct, efficient, and functional.

**✅ RESOLVED:** Implemented comprehensive sorting logic that:
- Supports both array format `[['column', 'ASC'], ['column2', 'DESC']]` and single column string format
- Validates columns against a whitelist to prevent SQL injection
- Properly handles NULLS LAST for nullable columns like `rating` and `publishing_date`
- Provides intelligent defaults when invalid sorting parameters are provided
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing hardcoded sorting behavior

### [x] A-004 **Insufficient Input Validation in API Routes**
**File:** `src/app/api/books/route.ts:105-118`
**Issue:** Basic validation exists but inputs are not sanitized before database operations.
**Impact:** Potential injection vulnerabilities and malformed data issues.
**Recommendation:** Add input sanitization and more comprehensive validation.

### [x] A-005 **Base64 Decoding Error Handling**
**File:** `src/middleware.ts:38-40`
**Issue:** Base64 decoding lacks specific error handling for malformed session data.
**Impact:** Malformed session data could cause runtime errors.
**Recommendation:** Add specific error handling for base64 decoding failures.

## Medium Priority Issues (Code Quality & Maintainability)

### [x] A-006 **Extensive Commented Code**

**Files:** Multiple files contain large blocks of commented code

- `src/app/page.tsx:33, 51-66`
- `src/lib/db.ts:166-183, 233-289`
- `src/app/api/books/route.ts:37-68, 147`
  **Issue:** Dead code accumulation makes the codebase harder to maintain.
  **Impact:** Reduced code readability and maintenance burden.
  **Recommendation:** Remove commented code or move to commit history.

**✅ RESOLVED:** Successfully cleaned up commented code:
- Removed all commented code blocks from `src/app/page.tsx` (background gradient, feature cards, alternative description, unused imports)
- Removed commented sorting logic from `src/app/api/books/route.ts` (32+ lines)
- Note: `src/lib/db.ts` was refactored as part of A-007, removing commented code in the process
- Additional finding: `src/components/books/book-shelf.tsx` is entirely commented out (117 lines) and unused - candidate for deletion

### [x] A-007 **Large File Sizes**

**Files:** `src/lib/db.ts (686 lines)`, `src/components/HTML5Player.tsx (12469 bytes)`
**Issue:** Very large files that could be split for better maintainability.
**Impact:** Harder to navigate and maintain large files.
**Recommendation:** Consider splitting large files into smaller modules.

**✅ RESOLVED:** Successfully refactored both files:
- `src/lib/db.ts` split into 6 focused modules (client, types, utils, queries/books, queries/audiobooks, index)
- `src/components/HTML5Player.tsx` split into 11 focused modules (main component, 3 hooks, 5 UI components, types, utils)
- All functionality preserved with backward compatibility
- Build passes with no errors
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle

### [x] A-008 **Inconsistent Error Handling**

**Files:** Multiple API routes
**Issue:** Inconsistent error response formats across API endpoints.
**Impact:** Inconsistent API behavior for frontend consumers.
**Recommendation:** Standardize error response format.

**✅ RESOLVED:** Implemented comprehensive error handling standardization:
- Created `src/lib/api-error-handler.ts` with `ApiError` class, `handleApiError()`, and `HttpStatus` constants
- Created `src/types/api.ts` with standardized error response type definitions
- Updated all major API routes to use standardized error handling:
  - `/api/books` (GET, POST)
  - `/api/books/[id]` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
  - `/api/audiobooks/[book_id]` (GET, POST)
  - `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/activate`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/session`
  - `/api/user/preferences` (GET, PATCH)
  - `/api/system/log` (POST)
  - `/api/download-book/[book_id]` (GET)
- Created `API_STANDARDS.md` with comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- Verified frontend compatibility - all components already use `error` field from responses
- Italian error messages preserved in authentication routes

### [x] A-009 **Code Organization Issues**

**File:** `src/lib/db.ts`
**Issue:** Multiple responsibilities in single large file (database operations, type definitions, utilities).
**Impact:** Violates single responsibility principle and makes testing difficult.
**Recommendation:** Split into separate modules for queries, types, and utilities.

**✅ RESOLVED:** Refactored as part of A-007. Database layer now properly organized with clear separation of concerns.

### [x] A-010 **Missing useEffect in useAudiobook Hook**

**File:** `src/hooks/use-audiobook.ts:10-88`
**Issue:** The `fetchAudiobook` function is defined but never called automatically when `bookId` changes.
**Impact:** Audiobook data won't be loaded when the hook is used unless manually triggered.
**Recommendation:** Add useEffect to automatically fetch audiobook when bookId changes.

**✅ RESOLVED:** Added useEffect hook that automatically fetches audiobook data when bookId changes. Implemented with AbortController for proper cleanup when bookId changes rapidly. Removed manual fetchAudiobook calls from components.

### [x] A-011 **Double API Calls in updatePreference**

**File:** `src/hooks/use-user-preferences.ts:69-95`
**Issue:** `updatePreferences` is called twice - once in the try block and again in the auth context.
**Impact:** Unnecessary duplicate API calls and potential race conditions.
**Recommendation:** Remove the redundant call or ensure single execution.

**✅ RESOLVED:** Removed redundant `setPreferences` call. The auth context's `updatePreferences` already handles both the API call and state update. The hook's useEffect properly syncs from user.preferences to local state. Added comprehensive documentation explaining the state flow.

### [x] A-012 **Missing fetchBooks Dependency in useBookFilters**

**File:** `src/hooks/use-book-filters.ts:24-26`
**Issue:** `fetchBooks` is destructured but commented out and not included in useEffect dependencies.
**Impact:** Hook may not work correctly if fetchBooks is needed in the future.
**Recommendation:** Either use fetchBooks properly or remove it entirely.

**✅ RESOLVED:** Removed unnecessary `fetchBooks` destructuring and eslint-disable comment. Analysis showed that `updateFilters` and `updateSort` already call `fetchBooks` internally, so direct access is not needed. Also fixed memory leak by replacing timeout state with useRef and adding proper cleanup useEffect.

### [ ] A-013 **Component Too Large and Complex**

**File:** `src/components/books/book-collection.tsx (570 lines)`
**Issue:** Single component handles data fetching, state management, UI rendering, and error handling.
**Impact:** Violates single responsibility principle and makes testing/maintenance difficult.
**Recommendation:** Split into smaller, focused components and custom hooks.

### [ ] A-014 **Inconsistent State Management Patterns**

**File:** `src/components/books/book-collection.tsx:47-56`
**Issue:** Multiple local state objects (`localBooks`, `localIsLoading`, etc.) instead of using context.
**Impact:** Complex state synchronization and potential inconsistencies.
**Recommendation:** Use React context or state management libraries consistently.

### [ ] A-015 **Memory Leak in Debounced Search**

**File:** `src/components/books/book-collection.tsx:294-304`
**Issue:** Timeout references stored in state but not properly cleaned up on unmount.
**Impact:** Potential memory leaks in long-running applications.
**Recommendation:** Use useRef for timeout references and clean up in useEffect cleanup.

### [ ] A-016 **Hardcoded API URLs in Components**

**File:** `src/components/books/book-collection.tsx:126, 255, 362`
**Issue:** Direct API calls scattered throughout component instead of centralized data fetching.
**Impact:** Tight coupling and makes testing/mocking difficult.
**Recommendation:** Move API logic to custom hooks or service layers.

## Low Priority Issues (Code Style & Best Practices)

### [ ] L-001 **Magic Numbers**

**Files:** Multiple locations
**Issue:** Hardcoded pagination defaults (`perPage = 10`, `page = 1`).
**Impact:** Magic numbers scattered throughout codebase reduce readability.
**Recommendation:** Extract to configuration constants.

### [ ] L-002 **Inconsistent Comment Styles**

**Files:** Various files
**Issue:** Mix of JSDoc comments and regular comments.
**Impact:** Inconsistent documentation style affects code maintainability.
**Recommendation:** Standardize comment format throughout codebase.

### [ ] L-003 **Unused Configuration Options**

**File:** `src/lib/db.ts:67-77`
**Issue:** Complex `BookQueryOptions` interface with some unused parameters.
**Impact:** Interface complexity without corresponding functionality.
**Recommendation:** Remove or implement unused options.

## Warnings (Code Style & Consistency)

### [ ] W-001 **Inconsistent Import Patterns**

**Files:** `src/app/layout.tsx:4`, `src/app/page.tsx:4`
**Issue:** Mixing of `React` and direct imports.
**Recommendation:** Use consistent import style throughout the application.

### [ ] W-002 **Hardcoded Values in Components**

**File:** `src/app/page.tsx:74`
**Issue:** `displayPreviews={0}` hardcoded in BookCollectionWrapper.
**Recommendation:** Use named constants or configuration.

### [ ] W-003 **Variable Naming Inconsistencies**

**Files:** `src/context/auth-context.tsx:61`, `src/context/auth-context.tsx:112`
**Issue:** Inconsistent variable naming (`error_catched`, `error_response`).
**Recommendation:** Use consistent camelCase naming throughout.

### [ ] W-004 **Type Organization**

**File:** `src/types/index.ts:1-4`
**Issue:** `AudioBookInfo` interface defined outside main export scope.
**Recommendation:** Move all interfaces to proper export locations.

## Performance Issues (Non-Critical)

### [ ] P-001 **Client-Side Data Fetching**

**File:** `src/components/books/previews-collection.tsx:25-44`
**Issue:** Direct fetch calls in useEffect without error boundaries.
**Impact:** Potential unhandled promise rejections in development.
**Recommendation:** Add error boundaries and loading states.

### [ ] P-002 **Database Query Optimization**

**File:** `src/lib/db.ts:185`
**Issue:** Hardcoded sort order (`ORDER BY has_audio ASC, display_order ASC`).
**Impact:** Limited flexibility in sorting options for users.
**Recommendation:** Make sorting configurable through function parameters.

## Security Issues (Configuration)

### [ ] S-001 **Security Headers Duplication**

**Files:** `src/middleware.ts:21-26`, `next.config.ts:37-38`
**Issue:** Security headers defined in both middleware and Next.js config.
**Impact:** Maintenance overhead and potential conflicts.
**Recommendation:** Centralize security headers in one location.

### [ ] S-002 **Environment File Configuration**

**Issue:** Environment files are in .gitignore but configuration suggests they may contain sensitive data.
**Impact:** Potential credential exposure if .gitignore is not properly configured.
**Recommendation:** Verify .gitignore effectiveness and consider additional security measures.
