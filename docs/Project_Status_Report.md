## Project Status Report

I'll analyze the Digital Library project files and provide a comprehensive report. Let me think through this step by step.

Project Analysis Report:

1. Project Structure Overview:

-   Next.js 15 project with App Router
-   Uses shadcn/ui components
-   Implements TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
-   Has proper context providers for auth and library management
-   Includes comprehensive type definitions

2. Issues Found:

A. Missing Critical Files:

-   No local API route handlers in `/app/api/` directory
-   Missing Middleware for auth protection
-   Missing error.tsx for error boundary
-   Missing loading.tsx for suspense boundaries
-   No database configuration or ORM setup

B. Component Issues:

-   Redundant book-dialog.tsx and book-details-dialog.tsx
-   Missing error boundaries in several components
-   Some components lack proper loading states
-   Theme switching might cause hydration issues

C. Type/Interface Issues:

-   Some interfaces are defined but not properly used
-   Missing API route type definitions
-   Incomplete error handling types

3. Authentication Flow Issues:

-   No proper session management implementation
-   Missing password reset flow
-   Incomplete activation flow
-   No CSRF protection implementation

4. File Issues:

-   Missing icon and image assets
-   Incomplete test files
-   No proper data seeding mechanism
-   Missing API documentation

Priority-Ranked To-Do List:

HIGH PRIORITY:

1. [ ] Implement API route handlers for:
    - Authentication (login, register, logout)
    - Book management (CRUD operations)
    - User preferences
2. [ ] Add proper middleware for authentication
3. [ ] Implement database configuration and models
4. [ ] Add error.tsx and loading.tsx for proper error/loading states
5. [ ] Fix redundant dialog components
6. [ ] Add CSRF protection

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

1. [ ] Complete user activation flow
2. [ ] Add password reset functionality
3. [ ] Implement proper session management
4. [ ] Add proper error boundaries
5. [ ] Add data seeding mechanism
6. [ ] Implement proper loading states

LOW PRIORITY:

1. [ ] Add comprehensive tests
2. [ ] Create API documentation
3. [ ] Add image optimization
4. [ ] Improve accessibility
5. [ ] Add analytics

Let me create an artifact to help verify the current project status with a test script:

Would you like me to help implement any of these missing components or fix any specific issues? We should start with the highest priority items first. I recommend beginning with either:

1. Implementing the API route handlers for authentication and book management
2. Setting up the database configuration and models
3. Adding proper error boundaries and loading states
4. Fixing the redundant dialog components

Which area would you like to focus on first?
