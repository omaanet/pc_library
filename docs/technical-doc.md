# Digital Library

## Project Overview
The Digital Library is a modern web application built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It features a responsive design with both grid and list views for books, dark/light theme support, and comprehensive book management capabilities.

The Digital Library is composed only of a home page where user can browse the available books.
The style must be modern, minimalistic with an artistic feeling and look, something that reminds you of libraries, books and reading..

Books have few simple properties: cover image, title, publishing date, brief summeary, audio version availability, audio length.
When user click on a book he can view the details with a larger cover image and a brief extract.
If the user is registered, he can access the entire book or listen to the audio version (if available).

The Digital Library has user private area where he can change the password and manage his preferences.

The Digital Library uses a modal dialog for register and login.
The registration process is extremely simple:

1) user clicks on register and compile a simple form with: email (required, validated), full name (required);
2) the user receives a welcome email with an activation link;
3) the user clicks on the activation link and the activation page asks the user to enter his password;
4) the user is activated with the choosen password and is automatically redirected to the home page;
5) the user receives a confirmation and welcome email.

- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy

## Development Workflow
1. Setup development environment
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure ESLint and Prettier
4. Start development server
5. Build and deploy
